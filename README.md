# landing-page

This project will focus on utilizing the
knowledge learned from HTML and CSS to
make a landing page for a webpage.

This is key for developing my abilities for
projects I may make in the future for 
the Odin Project as well as future employment.

The key feature I am focusing on is my
FlexBox utilization.
