          <p>This website is awesome</p>
          <p>This website has some subtext
            that goes here under the main
            title. It's a smaller font and the 
            color is lower contrast.

    <!-- Quote section -->
    <div>
      <p>This is an inspiring quote, or a 
        testimonial from a customer. Maybe it's
        just filling up space, or maybe people
        will actually read it. Who knows?
        All I know is that it looks nice.
